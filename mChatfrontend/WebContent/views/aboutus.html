<h3>Stories that make us who we are</h3>

<div class="div1">
<p style="font-size:25px;color:white;text-align:left;"> mChat is all about posting blog and chating with friends</p>
<p style="font-size:16px;color:red;text-align:left;"><b>Credits</b></p>

<p style="font-size:16px;color:white;text-align:left;">
Chating and posting on mChat is a collaborative work, and the efforts of individual contributors to a page are recorded in that page's 
history, which is publicly viewable. Information on the authorship of images and other media, such as sound files, can be found 
by clicking on the image itself or the nearby information icon to display the file page, which includes the author and source,
 where appropriate, along with other information.</p>

<h6 style="font-size:16px;color:white;text-align:left;">Several mechanisms are in place to help e-Shop members carry out the important work of crafting a high-quality resource 
while maintaining civility. Editors are able to watch pages and technically skilled persons can write editing programs to 
keep track of or rectify bad edits. Where there are disagreements on how to display facts, editors often work together to
 compile an article that fairly represents current expert opinion on the subject.
<br><br>
Although the e-Shop Foundation owns the site, it is largely uninvolved in writing and daily operations.</h6>
